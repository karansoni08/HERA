## 1. Executive Summary

**HERA (Human Engineered Risk Analysis)** is a comprehensive, modular analytics framework designed to identify, quantify, and visualize human-centric security risks within an organization.  
The system leverages behavioral data, contextual mappings, and quantitative scoring to produce transparent, actionable insights for both technical and managerial stakeholders.

At its core, HERA applies the **OMEO framework** — **Origin, Method, Exposure, Outcome** — to bridge the gap between raw behavioral signals and meaningful business risk narratives.  
This structured approach enhances explainability, supports decision-making, and helps prioritize mitigation efforts across departments.

### 🔹 Key Capabilities
- **Data-Driven Risk Scoring:** Uses the *Human Threat Index (HTI)* to evaluate user-level risk based on behavioral patterns, impact potential, and detectability.  
- **Contextual Intelligence:** Translates technical signals into human-understandable OMEO mappings, linking behaviors to likely outcomes and exposures.  
- **Automated Reporting:** Generates Markdown-based executive reports and data previews directly from pipeline outputs, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.  
- **Visual Insights:** Produces intuitive risk charts and departmental breakdowns for fast, informed decision-making.  
- **Scalable Design:** Modular pipeline allows easy integration with real enterprise data sources and future expansion into dashboards or ML-driven analysis.

### 🔹 Business Value
- Provides **measurable visibility** into human behavior–driven security risks.  
- Enables **data-backed prioritization** of awareness training, access reviews, and monitoring efforts.  
- Promotes **explainability and traceability**, essential for governance, audit, and leadership reporting.  
- Designed for **repeatability and extensibility**, making it suitable for long-term integration within the organization’s threat modeling ecosystem.

> In short, **HERA transforms fragmented human-risk signals into structured, explainable intelligence** — empowering organizations to better understand, quantify, and manage the human element of cybersecurity.
